Introduction
===================

The Editor is where you set up keys and rules, create identities and schemas, define your a/b tests and gradual releases.
It is your dashboard for controlling your configurations and your features remotely.
The rich UI makes it accessible to employees who are not software engineers such as Product Managers, QAs, Sales and managers at higher positions.
